# 3D Construction of Projections in Geogebra
The repository contains Geogebra files for learning 3D projections on a mirror Z-, X, and I-construction of 3D point and lines.

## Basic Geometry in Front of the Mirror
The perspective drawing creates an image of an object in front of a mirror. The eye observing the projective image from a point Z. 
Assume the observer is painting the perspective image of a vertical line/stick on the surface of the mirror.

Considering the perpective construction from the side will lead to the following situation.
